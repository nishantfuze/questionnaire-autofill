Question	Answer	Confidence Score	Evidence
1. Is it only an API platform or do we need to build the front end platform?	Fuze operates an API-first architecture that enables banks to retain full control over the product UI and end-to-end customer journey. Fuze provides the backend infrastructure via REST APIs and WebSockets, while the bank owns and builds the front-end. Fuze provides advisory support on UX and journey design but ultimate ownership of the front-end remains with the bank.	95	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 11 > "How customizable is the product UX"]
2. Would Mashreq host the entire solution or can Fuze host it?	The solution is hosted on Fuze's AWS Public Cloud infrastructure (me-central-1 region in UAE). Fuze can provide a segregated tenant on AWS PrivateLink if required. Mashreq does not need to host the solution; Fuze hosts it within a compliant UAE-based cloud environment.	92	[rbgplatformquestionnaire > Networking & Connectivity > Row 18]
3. Who will develop the front end (Mashreq or Fuze)?	Mashreq will develop the front end. Fuze supports an API-first integration model and does not recommend SDK integration. The bank retains full control over the product UI and customer journey. Fuze provides REST APIs and WebSockets for integration, along with comprehensive API documentation.	95	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 34 > Integration Model]; [rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 6 > SDK]
4. Community of users and availability of resources for the platform?	Fuze has active bank partnerships with Wio Bank, ADCB, and Ruya Bank in the UAE. One in four new Wio users sign up for digital asset investment through Fuze. Volume on Wio platform alone exceeds all local exchanges combined. Two additional large-scale fintechs/financial institutions are scheduled for go-live in Q2-Q3 2025.	90	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 53-54 > References]; [TPRM Due Diligence > Row 2]
5. Need clarification on what VDI means in the RBGP Platform	Insufficient information in provided documents. VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) is not explicitly referenced in the knowledge base documents.	20	[No direct reference found - requires clarification from Mashreq]
6. Please provide need clarification if this FE build or BE build?	Fuze provides backend (BE) infrastructure only. The front-end (FE) build is owned and developed by the bank. Fuze's API-first architecture provides all backend services including trading, custody, compliance, and order execution via REST APIs and WebSockets.	95	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 34]; [rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 3-6]
7. Does Mashreq have a dedicated FE team to implement?	This is a question for Mashreq to confirm internally. Fuze's model requires the bank to have a front-end development team to integrate with Fuze's APIs.	0	[N/A - Question for Mashreq to answer]
8. The analytics and customer engagement would be owned by whom?	Analytics and customer engagement are owned by the bank. Fuze tracks KPIs including user activation rates, activation to first order, order success rates, user retention and churn, and AUM. Fuze's APIs allow the bank to monitor and track these KPIs on their own data management system.	88	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 18 > KPIs]
9. What SSO does Mashreq use?	This is a question for Mashreq to confirm internally. Fuze supports OAuth-based authentication and API key-based access. Fuze implements JWT validation with configurable token lifetimes and refresh flows for secure session continuity.	70	[rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 11-12 > Auth methods]; Partial - Mashreq must confirm their SSO
10. What is Mashreq's CI/CD pipeline?	This is a question for Mashreq to confirm internally. Fuze maintains its own daily CI/CD release schedule with rolling deployments for zero-downtime updates. All releases are logged in GitHub version control.	0	[N/A - Question for Mashreq to answer]
11. Does Mashreq want on prem?	Fuze's solution is cloud-hosted on AWS (me-central-1 UAE region). On-premise deployment is not the standard model. However, Fuze can provide a segregated tenant on AWS PrivateLink if required for enhanced security and private connectivity.	85	[rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 18]; [TPRM > Row 21]
12. Does Mashreq want SDK?	Fuze does not recommend SDK integration for banking partners as it introduces a single point of failure. Fuze provides and recommends REST APIs and webhooks instead, which offer the bank greater control over the integration. In the event of API issues, only connected features are affected.	95	[rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 6 > SDK]
13. Will Mashreq do Bank integration for withdrawal and deposit?	Yes, the bank handles fiat integration for deposits and withdrawals. Fuze's closed-loop model requires customers to fund via the bank's existing fiat rails. Fuze supports both open-loop and closed-loop models; in closed-loop, digital assets remain within the bank's controlled environment.	85	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 10 > Open/Closed loop]; [Questions_for_bidder > Row 17 > AUM growth]
14. Could we please get clarity on "Community of users and availability of resources for the platform"?	Fuze has established partnerships with UAE banks including Wio Bank, ADCB, and Ruya Bank. One in four new Wio users sign up for digital asset trading. Fuze maintains dedicated account managers and cross-functional support teams (product, operations, compliance) for each bank partnership. Fuze also provides comprehensive API documentation and integration guides.	90	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 48 > Account Manager]; [Row 53-54 > References]
Does Mashreq require a front end platform or intend to integrate into existing Mashreq Mobile App/Online Banking?	Fuze's standard model is API-first integration into the bank's existing front-end platforms. Fuze does not provide a hosted UI by default. The bank integrates Fuze's REST APIs and WebSockets into their existing mobile app or web banking platform, maintaining full ownership of the customer experience.	95	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 34]; [rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 3]
I. Trading Features - 1. Target list of cryptocurrencies at launch?	Fuze currently supports over 300 virtual assets.

Pricing changes can be effected within one business day.	78	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 4 > Roadmap]; [Row 16 > Pricing control]
I. Trading Features - 4. Staking and savings plans for major coins and stablecoins?	Yes, staking is on the roadmap for the next 12 months. Yield-generating products and staking allow customers to earn on their digital asset holdings in a compliant manner. Subsequent phases will introduce yield products and digital asset-backed lending.	85	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 4 > Roadmap - Staking]; [Row 70 > Partnership evolution]
II. Account Reporting - 1. Customizable trading environment examples?	Banks can customize supported tokens, commercial terms, country-specific KYC fields, and eligibility rules. The platform supports price segmentation, client-specific recommended portfolios, and tailored workflows by customer segment (mass, affluent, HNW).	82	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 15 > Segment differentiation]; [Row 27 > Market configuration]
II. Account Reporting - 2. End-of-day/monthly data feed format preference?	Fuze provides data via REST APIs allowing the bank to pull data into their own systems. All historic data is available via API. The platform supports comprehensive custodial records alongside detailed order execution data with reconciliation capabilities.	80	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 60 > Data portability]; [Row 28 > Custody records]
II. Account Reporting - 3. Specific data fields required?	Fuze's platform captures every API action as an "Event" logged to an immutable audit service for end-to-end tracing. Data includes transaction records, order execution data, custodial records, access logs, and critical system activities. Logs are retained for 8 years for regulatory compliance.	78	[rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 43 > Logging]; [TPRM > Row 23 > Data retention]
II. Account Reporting - 4. Other reporting or data requirements?	Fuze provides real-time metrics including latency, throughput (up to 1000 TPS), and error rates via Grafana dashboards or Prometheus endpoints. Monthly platform fee covers the full stack of services. Audit logs are retained for 8 years with quarterly internal audits.	75	[rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 44 > Metrics]; [Row 15 > Key rotation audit]
III. Settlement - 1. Expected reconciliation and settlement workflows?	The platform maintains comprehensive custodial records alongside detailed order execution data. Fuze performs reconciliation between execution data and custodial records to ensure consistency, accuracy, and integrity of transaction flows. Transaction SLAs include 45 mins or less for stablecoin transfers.	82	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 28 > Reconciliation]; [rbgplatformquestionnaire > Row 37 > SLAs]
III. Settlement - 2. Specific data points for reconciliation?	Reconciliation covers execution data vs custodial records. Key data points include transaction records, order execution timestamps, wallet holdings, and fiat ledger entries. Holdings can be independently verified on the blockchain via Proof of Reserves in FuzeOS.	78	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 28-29 > Reconciliation & Segregation]
IV. Custody - 1. HSMs/MPC architectural preferences?	Fuze employs multi-party computation (MPC) based custody through Fireblocks (first to achieve CCSS Level 3 certification). Multi-signature technology requires multiple keys held in geographically distributed locations. Fuze also works with HexTrust (VARA licensed) and Tungsten (FSRA licensed) for custody.	92	[TPRM > Row 52 > Custody providers]; [Questions_for_bidder > Row 72 > Key management]
IV. Custody - 2. Wallet segregation requirements by user/asset type?	All bank customers' assets are held in segregated hot and cold wallets. Wallet addresses are visible to the bank via Proof of Reserves in FuzeOS for independent blockchain verification. Fuze supports both logical and physical segregation of data with RBAC and ACL controls.	90	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 29 > Segregation]; [TPRM > Row 22 > Environment segregation]
IV. Custody - 3. Managing end-client assets vision?	Customer assets remain the property of end clients at all times. Assets are held in segregated wallets, ring-fenced and bankruptcy-remote. In event of service termination, Fuze facilitates orderly wind-down with asset transfers based on explicit client/bank instructions. The bank can liquidate digital assets and return funds through bank channels.	92	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 63 > Service termination]; [Row 28 > Custody]
V. Operational Requirements - 1. Fund flow workflows between CASA and crypto wallets?	Fuze recommends starting with a closed-loop model where customers fund via the bank's existing CASA rails. The bank handles fiat deposit/withdrawal integration. Fuze processes the crypto trade execution. As partnership matures, open-loop capabilities can be added for external transfers with Travel Rule compliance.	85	[Questions_for_bidder > Row 10 > Closed/Open loop]; [Row 17 > AUM growth model]
