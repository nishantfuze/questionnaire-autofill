,Question,Vendor Response,Notes
API & Protocols,,,
API & Protocols,"API types supported (REST, WebSocket, FIX 4.2/4.4/5.0 SP2, gRPC).","Fuze provides robust APIs designed for seamless integration with third-party systems, including government and financial institution systems. The tech stack includes REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time communication and trading.",
API & Protocols,"For FIX: sessions (initiator/acceptor), compIDs, heartbeat/sequence policies, reset behavior.","Fuze does not support FIX right now, this can be developed if required.",
API & Protocols,"For REST/WebSocket: base URLs, versioning strategy, pagination, idempotency keys.","Fuze’s technology stack leverages REST APIs and WebSockets to enable real-time communication and trading. The platform offers robust, well-structured APIs designed for seamless integration with third-party systems, supported by comprehensive documentation, including detailed integration guides and step-by-step walkthroughs for technical teams.  Fuze also supports pagination for APIs where it is required, ensuring efficient handling of large data sets. In addition, the platform places strong emphasis on idempotency an essential requirement for financial integrations so that operations are not unintentionally duplicated if requests are retried due to network issues or other failures. This is achieved through the use of unique, client-defined identifiers for key resources, helping maintain consistency and data integrity across all transactions.",
API & Protocols,"Supported SDKs/libraries and language coverage (Java/Kotlin, .NET, Node, Python, Go).","We do not recommend an SDK integration for our banking partners, as it introduces a single point of failure. In other words, an issue with the SDK could potentially disrupt the entire app. Instead, we provide and recommend REST APIs and webhooks, which offer banking partners greater control over the integration. In the event of any issues with the APIs, only the connected features are affected, allowing the rest of the banking experience to continue as normal.",
API & Protocols,Rate limits per endpoint and burst behavior; error model and retry/backoff guidance.,"While rate limits and burst limits are enforced, they are set high enough that hitting them should not be a concern.",
API & Protocols,"Async eventing: topics/streams, message schemas, replay, durable subscriptions.","Fuze does implement event-driven architecture with asynchronous eventing capabilities. The platform incorporates an event based PubSub (Publish-Subscribe) mechanism that enables real-time event-driven communication between services. This architecture allows the system to decouple components, ensuring that transactions can be processed independently and in parallel, which helps maintain performance even as transaction volumes increase. The event based architecture is critical in ensuring that consumers don't have to manage message retries and can scale horizontally without the need for ZooKeeper or equivalent tools to manage state. All consumers are stateless with state stored in persistent databases, which supports the asynchronous processing model.",
,,,
Authentication & Authorization,,,
Authentication & Authorization,"Auth methods (OAuth2, mutual TLS, HMAC, API keys, FIX logon).","We support both OAuth-based authentication and API key–based access, giving flexibility depending on your integration needs.",
Authentication & Authorization,Support for OIDC and JWT validation; token lifetimes and refresh flows.,"The platform supports JWT validation, ensuring that all tokens are securely verified for authenticity, integrity, and expiration before requests are processed. Configurable token lifetimes are enforced to balance security and usability, with clear expiration policies in place.  In addition, refresh token flows are supported, allowing clients to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating, while maintaining strong security controls. This approach enables seamless session continuity and secure access management across integrations.",
Authentication & Authorization,"mTLS requirements (CA chain, cipher suites, SNI).",Fuze secures all traffic via TLS 1.2+ and has the technical capability to implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for specific banking integrations if required,
Authentication & Authorization,Role‑based access control scopes/permissions per endpoint.,"Fuze implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all APIs, allowing for the definition of granular user-level and API-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) based on functional requirements,. This is enforced via a Zero Trust architecture and Single Sign-On (SSO), ensuring only authorized personnel with specific permissions can access protected endpoints",
Authentication & Authorization,Key/secret rotation processes and auditability; emergency revocation.,"Cryptographic keys are protected by strict lifecycle management, including immediate emergency revocation procedures for departing staff and remote wipe capabilities for compromised devices,. All key access changes are recorded in immutable audit logs retained for 8 years and undergo quarterly internal audits to ensure compliance and effective revocation",
,,,
Networking & Connectivity,,,
Networking & Connectivity,"Public internet vs private connectivity (AWS PrivateLink, VPN, Direct Connect).","The solution is hosted on the AWS Public Cloud (me-central-1) and primarily utilizes HTTPS over the public internet secured by TLS 1.2+ for standard communication,. For internal segmentation and secure remote access, Fuze employs a Zero Trust Network architecture (using TailScale) and software-controlled virtual private networks (Mesh VPN) rather than traditional direct leased lines. Fuze can provide a segreggated tenant on AWS PrivateLink if required.",
Networking & Connectivity,IP whitelisting/CIDR requirements; DNS/SNI expectations.,"Fuze implements strict IP whitelisting to ensure APIs are only called from authorized sources and supports IP blacklist controls via its API interfaces,. Access control is further enforced at the DNS level using a Zero Trust system that validates identity and authorization before granting access to resources",
Networking & Connectivity,Latency targets per region; jitter tolerance and clock synchronization (NTP/PTP).,The system is designed to provide a consistent response time of less than 2 seconds for front-end screens under normal and peak conditions,
Networking & Connectivity,Throughput limits and message size caps; compression support.,"The system is architected to support a maximum throughput of 1000 Transactions Per Second (TPS). To protect upstream resources, the solution implements application-level rate limiting alongside Cloudflare DDoS protection and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules",
Networking & Connectivity,Failover paths and BGP/route health checks if applicable.," Fuze utilizes a primary/primary failover mechanism with a ""Hot"" recovery site to ensure transparent failover and zero-downtime deployments across geographically separated data centres,.

,,,
Observability & Ops,,,
Observability & Ops,Logging schemas/correlation IDs; request IDs for end‑to‑end tracing.,"Fuze employs an event-based PubSub architecture where every API action is captured as an ""Event"" and logged to an immutable audit service (RDS) for end-to-end tracing. Access logs and critical system activities are centralized in a SIEM (Wazuh) and retained for 8 years to ensure full regulatory compliance and auditability. Fuze also supports tracing using traceparent header for end to end tracebility",
Observability & Ops,"Metrics exposed (latency, throughput, error rates) and consumption methods (Prometheus, CloudWatch).","The platform utilizes a TIG stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana) alongside an internal StatsD implementation to expose real-time metrics such as latency, throughput (up to 1000 TPS), and error rates. These metrics drive auto-scalability based on queue loads and are visualized via Grafana dashboards or integrated Prometheus endpoints",
Observability & Ops,"Alerting and incident management integration (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, email/webhooks).","Incident management is integrated with PagerDuty to dispatch alerts via SMS, email, and phone calls to support engineers for critical failures. Security incidents detected by the IDS/IPS and Wazuh SIEM automatically trigger notifications to the security team, ensuring immediate response to anomalies",
Observability & Ops,"Customer support SLAs, escalation paths, and regional coverage hours.","Support coverage is 09:30–17:30 GST on business days, with P1 (Critical) incidents carrying a strict SLA of 30-minute response and 8-hour resolution. Partners have access to a dedicated portal, email, and phone support, backed by a detailed escalation matrix including specific contacts for technical and compliance leadership",
Observability & Ops,"Status page, maintenance notifications, and postmortem access.","Planned maintenance is notified 72 hours in advance (limited to 8 hours/month), while material API changes require a 14-day notice period. Emergency updates are communicated within 24 hours, and clients can generate real-time performance and availability trend reports directly through the web interface",
,,,
