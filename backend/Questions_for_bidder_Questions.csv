,"What asset classes do you currently support natively (e.g. equities, ETFs, mutual funds, crypto, commodities, precious metals, derivatives)?",Presentation,"We currently support crypto as an asset class, with plans to add other asset classes in future",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Which products are live today vs. on your roadmap (12–24 months)?,," Live Today Sharia-compliant trading flow — the only company globally live with Sharia compliance approved by HSE (CBUAE) Limit orders Multiple portfolios per user Closed-loop model (recommended) — customers cannot bring in external crypto Open-loop model — once the bank is comfortable with the risk framework, we can transition to this  Next 12 Months Staking Tokenized Commodities (Gold, Silver) Collateralization workflows Tokenized assets — RWAs (Real-World Assets) Cohort-based pricing  Next 24 Months Vaults — access to yield instruments via stablecoins Derivatives and strategy-based trading Tokenized assets — Stocks Crypto cards  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Can the platform support multi-asset investing within a single customer journey?,,Not at the moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Do you support fractional investing? Minimum ticket sizes?,,"Fuze’s trading infrastructure is natively built to support fractional trading, as crypto assets are inherently divisible. This allows for high flexibility in trade sizes, including micro-transactions for example, purchasing fractions of tokens equivalent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"How do you handle corporate actions, dividends, splits, rights issues?",,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Is portfolio aggregation across asset classes supported out of the box?,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Describe your order types (market, limit, stop-loss, recurring, thematic).",,"We offer market, limit, and stop-loss order types, and for recurring orders for crypto for all tokens. We also provide modular APIs that allow flexible configuration and control that allow for thematic investing to be offered",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Can we define custom product wrappers (e.g. gold accounts, Shariah-compliant portfolios, bundles)?",,"We support the creation of theme-based portfolios that allow banks to curate digital asset exposure around specific narratives or customer preferences. Examples include AI-focused tokens, blue-chip digital assets, and real-world asset (RWA)–linked tokens, enabling simplified investment discovery and portfolio construction.  For more sophisticated segments, we enable structured digital asset products for qualified investors, designed to meet suitability, risk, and regulatory requirements while offering differentiated risk–return profiles.  We also support Shariah-compliant Bitcoin trading, allowing Islamic banking customers to participate in digital assets within an approved Shariah framework.  The platform supports both open-loop and closed-loop models.  In an open-loop setup, customers can transfer digital assets in and out of the platform, enabling broader ecosystem participation.  In a closed-loop setup, digital assets remain within the bank’s controlled environment, offering enhanced oversight, governance, and risk management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How customizable is the product UX without core changes on your side?,,"Fuze operates an API-first architecture that enables banks to retain full control over the product UI and end-to-end customer journey.   Fuze provides advisory support on UX and journey design, drawing on implementation experience and best practices across similar deployments; however, ultimate ownership and decision-making on UX and customer experience remain with the bank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Business Ownership & Commercial Model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What is your standard commercial and revenue-sharing model?,,"Our commercial model is designed to be simple, transparent, and aligned with partner growth.  It typically includes a one-time integration fee and an ongoing relationship management fee, followed by a monthly platform fee that covers the full stack of services. We do not charge separately for custody, compliance, or core operational components—these are included as part of the platform offering.  In addition,  partners earn a fee on customer activity through a transaction spread. This ensures commercial alignment, as revenues scale with customer adoption and usage.  Overall, this structure is highly competitive compared to traditional exchanges, which often charge 4–5% in fees to the retail customer. Our approach provides predictable costs for the bank while maximising long-term revenue potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do you support bank-branded propositions (white-label vs co-brand)?,,"Our solution is fully white-label by default, enabling banks to offer digital asset products entirely under their own brand and maintain full ownership of the customer relationship.  Where regulatory or disclosure requirements require partner visibility, we support co-branding, implemented in a controlled and compliant manner. This ensures transparency for regulators while keeping the bank-led brand experience intact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Can we design differentiated propositions by customer segment (mass, affluent, HNW)?",,"Yes — absolutely.  We can design differentiated propositions by customer segment (mass, affluent, HNW) across the broader product. Through capabilities like price segmentation, client-specific recommended portfolios, and tailored workflows, banks can offer distinct experiences per segment. Our modular APIs fully support this level of customization while remaining compliant with regulatory requirements. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What levers do we control vs what is fixed by your platform?,,"Spreads and markups are ultimately in the control of Fuze as Fuze is the regulated entity charging customers for a regulated service. While the bank may not have direct control, it can work with Fuze to offer differentiated pricing or change pricing. Changes once requests can be affected as fast as one business day.S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"How do you support AUM growth, trading velocity, and cross-sell?",,"We support AUM growth and trading velocity by starting with core trading in a closed-loop model, encouraging customers to consolidate assets within the bank’s ecosystem. As the partnership matures, we can progressively expand into open-loop capabilities, additional order types, and advanced trading functionality to increase engagement.  Cross-sell follows a phased roadmap jointly driven by Fuze and the bank — moving from spot trading to staking, yield products, and stablecoin-based infrastructure — positioning the bank as the primary platform for digitally native customers and SMEs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What KPIs do you actively track with partner banks?,,- User activation rates - Activation to first order - Order success rates - User retention and churn - AUM. - Our APIs also allow the bank to monitor and track these KPIs on their own data management system ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Can you share benchmarks from similar digital banks you work with?,,"Yes we can share benchmarks, but cognizant of the fact that these numbers are quite sensitive, we want to understand what kind of benchmarks you require",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regulatory, Compliance & Governance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,In which jurisdictions are you currently regulated and licensed?,Presentation,"We are licensed across UAE, Canada, sandbox approval in Jordan and operational approval for Turkey. We also have  upcoming other jurisduction in MEA and beyond",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What is your experience working with central banks and regulators?,Presentation,"We have an active and growing track record of engagement with central banks and regulators across the region, supported by a dedicated Regulatory Affairs function.  We have recently established a Regulatory Affairs Office, led by Serena Sebastiani, which proactively engages with regulators including VARA, CBUAE, SCA, CBB, CBJ, SAMA, and (higher Shariah Authoirty) HSA. This team works closely with regulatory stakeholders to understand and help scope evolving policies, including those impacting digital assets and the use of emerging technologies such as AI within regulated financial services.  The Regulatory Affairs Office brings a cumulative 30+ years of experience working with governments, regulators, and central banks across regulatory policy, supervision support, and market infrastructure initiatives. This enables us to engage constructively, anticipate regulatory direction, and ensure our platform and partner implementations remain aligned with supervisory expectations.  This proactive approach allows us to support partner banks not only in meeting current regulatory requirements, but also in preparing for future regulatory developments in a structured and informed manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do you support KYC / AML?,,"We follow a KYC reliance model with partner banks, whereby the KYC already collected by the bank is leveraged within our platform to enable seamless onboarding for most customers.  During integration, we conduct a detailed gap analysis with the bank to identify any additional KYC documentation, data fields, or compliance checks required for digital asset trading. Where needed, we work closely with the bank to solutionize and implement these requirements.  We also support enhanced due diligence (EDD), risk scoring, and investor/customer classification controls, with risk attributes and segmentation passed into the platform and enforced through eligibility rules, disclosures, and configurable onboarding workflows ensuring alignment with both internal bank policy and local regulatory expectations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do you support suitability & appropriateness tests?,,"Currently, there are no suitability or appropriateness tests mandated by our regulator for digital asset trading. As a result, such criteria are not enforced by default at the platform level.  However, given the white-labelled and configurable nature of our solution, banks have full flexibility to implement suitability assessments, risk profiling, or customer questionnaires within the onboarding and trading journey, based on their internal policies and regulatory interpretations.  We support the integration of these checks into the customer flow—such as knowledge assessments, risk disclosures, and product eligibility rules—ensuring the bank can apply its own suitability framework while leveraging our underlying trading and custody infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do you support risk profiling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do you support investor classification?,,"Currently, there are no suitability or appropriateness tests mandated by our regulator for digital asset trading. As a result, such criteria are not enforced by default at the platform level.  However, given the white-labelled and configurable nature of our solution, banks have full flexibility to implement suitability assessments, risk profiling, or customer questionnaires within the onboarding and trading journey, based on their internal policies and regulatory interpretations.  We support the integration of these checks into the customer flow—such as knowledge assessments, risk disclosures, and product eligibility rules—ensuring the bank can apply its own suitability framework while leveraging our underlying trading and custody infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Can regulatory rules be configured per market (e.g. Bahrain-CBB / Jordan-CBJ)?,,"Yes our infrastructure is built to be highly modular and configurable by market. When entering a new jurisdiction, we ensure the full stack is aligned with local regulatory requirements, including trade flows, fiat rails, on-chain rails, Travel Rule compliance, and KYC controls.  This modularity allows partner banks to configure supported tokens, commercial terms, and country-specific KYC fields based on internal policy and the applicable regulator (e.g., CBB, CBJ). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Who holds custody of assets?,,"Fuze hold custody of assests. The platform maintains comprehensive custodial records alongside detailed order execution data. It is fully capable of performing reconciliation between execution data and custodial records to ensure consistency, accuracy, and integrity of transaction flows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How is segregation of client assets handled?,,All the bank's customers' assets are held in segregated hot and cold wallets. These wallet addresses are known to the bank via the Proof of Reserves section in Fuze's back-office application (FuzeOS). Therefore holdings can be verified at any point independently on the blockchain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"What audit, reporting, and regulatory MIS do you provide?",,"Nishant Kumar, Anoop Krishnan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Have you supported regulatory inspections or audits for partner banks?,Nishant,"Yes. We have established a dedicated Fuze Advisory function that supports partner banks across regulatory inspections, internal audits, and assurance activities related to digital asset offerings.  This advisory capability brings together professionals with long-standing experience working with regulators, central banks, and supervisory authorities, including hands-on involvement in regulatory inspections and audit processes. The team supports partners with regulatory readiness, documentation, control frameworks, and inspection responses.  Fuze Advisory is now embedded within our overall product and services portfolio, ensuring that regulatory and audit considerations are addressed not as an afterthought, but as an integral part of solution design, implementation, and ongoing operations. This allows partner banks to approach regulatory engagements with greater confidence and preparedness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Technology, Architecture & Integration",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Describe your platform architecture (modular, microservices, APIs).",Presentation,"Fuze's platform is built on a modern, flexible architecture designed for scalability and reliability. Microservices Architecture: Fuze utilizes a microservices-based architecture with a modular approach for flexibility. Each microservice is designed to handle specific functions, enabling efficient scaling based on demand without impacting other parts of the system. The infrastructure is modular and scalable, allowing seamless integration, flexibility, and cost-efficient upgrades without the need to rebuild systems. Event-Driven Architecture: The platform incorporates an event-based PubSub (Publish-Subscribe) mechanism that allows for both horizontal and vertical scaling. This architecture enables real-time event-driven communication between services, decoupling components so transactions can be processed independently and in parallel, which helps maintain performance even as transaction volumes increase. All consumers are stateless with state stored in persistent databases, eliminating the need for ZooKeeper or equivalent state management tools. API Infrastructure: Fuze provides robust APIs designed for seamless integration with third-party systems, including government and financial institution systems. The tech stack includes REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time communication and trading. Cloud Infrastructure: The platform is built on AWS cloud infrastructure in the UAE me-central region, offering elastic scaling where computing power and storage can be dynamically adjusted based on transaction volume. Load balancing is implemented across multiple Availability Zones to ensure traffic is distributed evenly across the system. Database Layer: The architecture utilizes high-performance databases including PostgreSQL for transactional data, DynamoDB for high-availability document storage, and Influx for efficient time-series data management, with database sharding and replication techniques to handle increasing data volumes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,How do you handle peak volumes and scalability?,Presentation,"Fuze handles peak volumes and scalability through a comprehensive, multi-layered approach built on modern cloud architecture.  Performance Capacity: Fuze's platform can process 1,000 orders per second with current infrastructure not fully enabled. The system has demonstrated capability to handle peak loads of 20 million requests per week with average p90 latencies of 500ms, and has maintained over 99.99% uptime in 2024.  Elastic and Horizontal Scaling: The infrastructure is built on AWS cloud platforms offering elastic scaling, where computing power and storage dynamically adjust based on transaction volume. Since the architecture is horizontally scalable, whenever there are more than 500 orders pending, the system automatically spins up additional instances to handle the load, ensuring performance remains optimal during high-demand periods.  Microservices Architecture: The microservices-based design allows individual components to scale independently based on specific demand without impacting other parts of the system. Each microservice handles specific functions, enabling efficient targeted scaling.  Event-Driven Architecture: The event-based PubSub mechanism enables real-time event-driven communication between services, allowing transactions to be processed independently and in parallel. All consumers are stateless with state stored in persistent databases, enabling seamless horizontal scaling without complex state management.  Load Balancing: Load balancing is implemented across multiple Availability Zones in AWS, ensuring traffic is distributed evenly across the system so no single node or resource becomes overwhelmed.  Database Optimization: Database sharding and replication techniques distribute data across multiple servers and locations, allowing faster access and minimizing bottlenecks. Caching mechanisms at various levels store frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.  Automated Monitoring: The platform continuously monitors system performance and resource utilization using automated tools, identifying potential bottlenecks and scaling resources in real-time to meet increasing transaction volumes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure is bankruptcy-remote: customer assets are segregated and held separately from Fuze’s balance sheet. Accordingly, even in the unlikely event of Fuze’s insolvency, customer assets would remain ring-fenced and accessible. The partner bank would be able to liquidate the digital assets, where required, and return funds to customers through the bank’s channels.  In addition, wallets and asset holdings are maintained with institutional-grade custody arrangements and are fully insured (where applicable). As a result, there is no credit or insolvency risk to customer assets arising from Fuze.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our platform enables banks to launch bank-grade digital asset products—starting with trading and extending to cards, rewards, yield, and lending—within a compliant and scalable framework. Having delivered multiple first-of-their-kind launches in the region, including Shariah-compliant trading, we understand how to operate at the intersection of innovation, regulation, and customer trust.  Beyond technology, we act as a strategic partner to digital-first banks. We work closely with teams to design their digital asset strategy, define product sequencing, and align offerings with regulatory expectations and customer needs. This ensures digital assets are embedded into the bank’s broader proposition rather than operating as a standalone feature.  Finally, our API-first, modular architecture and multi-jurisdiction licensing experience allow digital-first banks to move faster, scale regionally, and continuously innovate—without compromising on governance, security, or customer experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do you future-proof the platform?,,"Product innovation is a core pillar of our platform, and it is closely guided by the needs and priorities of our strategic partners. Our roadmap is not developed in isolation, it is actively shaped by ongoing collaboration with partners to ensure relevance, regulatory alignment, and real customer value. The products are built in a modularised fashion enabling easy implementation  We engage partners through structured governance forums, including regular roadmap reviews and QBRs, where we share upcoming initiatives, gather feedback, and align on priorities. This feedback is systematically evaluated and incorporated into our product roadmap, ensuring that innovation is driven by real-world use cases rather than theoretical capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What innovation have you delivered to partners in the last 12 months?,,"Over the past 12 months, we have delivered multiple production-grade innovations in close collaboration with regulated partners.  A key milestone was the design and launch of a fully Shariah-compliant digital asset trading offering, covering product structuring, Shariah governance alignment, and regulatory execution.   From a trading capability perspective, we introduced advanced trading features, including limit orders and enhanced execution controls, allowing partners to offer more sophisticated trading experiences aligned with active and professional customer segments. We have also expanded vault-based trading capabilities, simplifying asset management and improving usability for retail users.  In parallel, we delivered open-loop capabilities, including integration with Travel Rule (TR) requirements, enabling compliant asset transfers across external counterparties and ecosystems.  Additionally, we launched a payments infrastructure stack for banks and platforms leveraging stablecoin rails for cross-border fund movements. This enables faster settlement, improved liquidity management, and cost-efficient  transfers ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do you see this partnership evolving beyond phase one?,,"We view this partnership as a long-term platform collaboration, with trading as the entry point and multiple value-adding products layered over time.  Phase One will focus on launching digital asset trading as the foundational product. This establishes customer adoption, regulatory alignment, and operational readiness while delivering immediate value to the bank’s customers.  Beyond this, we will work closely with the bank to progressively expand the product suite. The next step would be crypto-linked cards, enabling customers to seamlessly spend and use their digital assets in everyday life, effectively bridging digital assets with mainstream payments.  Subsequent phases would introduce yield-generating products and staking, allowing customers to earn on their digital asset holdings in a compliant and transparent manner. Over time, this can further evolve into digital asset–backed lending, unlocking liquidity while keeping customers within the bank’s ecosystem.  Through this phased approach, the partnership evolves from a single product launch into a comprehensive digital asset offering, driving higher engagement, new revenue streams, and long-term customer stickiness for the bank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Encryption keys management, bring your own keys.",,"Fuze implements comprehensive encryption key management as part of their security infrastructure. The platform uses end-to-end encryption for all data transmission using industry-standard encryption protocols such as TLS/SSL, and encrypts data at rest using strong encryption algorithms. For custody and wallet security, Fuze maintains onshore custody key backups in the UAE to ensure compliance with local regulations and minimize the risk of data loss or unauthorized access. The company employs multi-signature technology for key management, where multiple keys held in geographically distributed locations are required to authorize any transaction. This ensures that a single compromised location or key cannot lead to unauthorized access or asset movement. Redundant key storage methods are used to ensure that key backups are available and accessible in the event of technical failures without compromising security. All infrastructure, including private keys, data, and servers, is entirely hosted onshore in the UAE, ensuring full compliance with local data residency regulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Support for mTLS (Mutual TLS).,,Fuze secures all traffic via TLS 1.2+ and supports mutual TLS (mTLS) for specific banking integrations if required,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Any third-party security assessment reports.,,"The platform holds ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II certifications and undergoes annual third-party Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) and NESA audits, with reports available for review",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
